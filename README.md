## How is the repository structured?

- The codebase is located in the `agg_utils` (python scripts) and notebooks folder.
- Additional details can be found in markdown files in the `details` folder.
- Supplementary gifs are located in the `gifs` folder.
- See [notebooks README](notebooks/) for the more details.
  - The `0.*` notebooks contain data parsing and figure generation.
  - The `1.*` notebooks perform the core experiments (visual representativeness and visual stability).
- The `animations` folder contains html animations, which allow to inspect the phenomena in more detail.
